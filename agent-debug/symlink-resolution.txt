Symlink / package resolution inside devcontainer

Command run from /workspace:
- realpath node_modules/@tandem/ui-kit
  -> /workspace/packages/ui-kit

- realpath node_modules/ui
  -> /workspace/packages/ui

Interpretation:
- npm workspaces correctly symlink local packages into node_modules.
- Any import of "@tandem/ui-kit" resolves to the local workspace package at /workspace/packages/ui-kit.
- Any import of "ui" from code that uses the jsconfig paths will conceptually resolve to /workspace/packages/ui (and realpath confirms this module exists under node_modules as a workspace symlink).

Conclusion:
- There are no stale or incorrect symlinks for @tandem/ui-kit or ui in node_modules; both point to the expected workspace package directories.
