Restaurant page component trace (/apps/client/pages/restaurant/[slug].js)

1) Entry file
- /workspace/apps/client/pages/restaurant/[slug].js
  - Imports:
    - React, useEffect, useState from "react".
    - { ChatWidget, ThemeProvider, windmillCreekTheme } from "@tandem/ui-kit".
    - { useRouter } from "next/router".
  - Exports default function RestaurantPage that:
    - Uses useRouter to get slug.
    - Fetches restaurant, menus, faqs, and heroSrc via Next.js API routes.
    - Renders loading / error states.
    - Finally returns JSX wrapped in <ThemeProvider defaultTheme={windmillCreekTheme}> containing:
      - A full-screen hero section.
      - A single ChatWidget instance: `<ChatWidget restaurantId={restaurant?.id || slug} />`.
  - No other local imports, wrappers, or re-exports.

2) Upstream providers / wrappers
- /workspace/apps/client/pages/_app.js
  - Imports { ThemeProvider, windmillCreekTheme } from "@tandem/ui-kit".
  - Wraps all pages in a ui-kit ThemeProvider:
    - `<ThemeProvider theme={windmillCreekTheme}> <Component {...pageProps} /> </ThemeProvider>`.
- There is no reference to the legacy `ui` package or its ChatWidget anywhere in _app.js.

3) Other routes for comparison
- /workspace/apps/client/pages/index.js
- /workspace/apps/client/pages/chat.js
- /workspace/apps/client/pages/demo/windmill-creek.js
  - All now import { ChatWidget } from "@tandem/ui-kit" as well (not from "ui").

4) Search for wrappers using legacy ui ChatWidget
- Grep across apps/client with includeIgnoredFiles for patterns:
  - `import { ChatWidget } from "ui"` / 'ui'
  - `export { ChatWidget } from "ui"` / 'ui'
- Result: **no matches found**.
- This indicates there is no wrapper or HOC re-exporting ChatWidget from the legacy packages/ui anywhere under apps/client.

5) Component tree summary for restaurant route
- _app.js: provides ui-kit ThemeProvider to all pages.
- [slug].js: imports ChatWidget directly from @tandem/ui-kit and renders it inside a (redundant but harmless) nested ThemeProvider.
- The ui-kit ChatWidget implementation imported is the Figma-style widget from dist/components/chat/ChatWidget.js, which itself uses ChatTrigger and Figma header/bubble components.

Conclusion:
- There is no evidence of any wrapper, layout, or HOC overriding the restaurant page’s ChatWidget with the legacy packages/ui ChatWidget.
- The only ChatWidget reachable from [slug].js is the one exported by @tandem/ui-kit; the compiled bundle confirms this.
