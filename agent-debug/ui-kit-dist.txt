index.js:
- Serves as the main entrypoint referenced by packages/ui-kit/package.json ("main": "dist/index.js").
- Should re-export ChatWidget, ChatTrigger, and related components from the compiled TypeScript sources.

Note: The presence of dist/index.js and compiled components confirms that `npm run build` for @tandem/ui-kit succeeded. Any consumer importing from "@tandem/ui-kit" will load from this dist output.
