Alias resolution and imports used by apps/client

apps/client/jsconfig.json:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "ui/*": ["../../packages/ui/*"],
      "ui": ["../../packages/ui"]
    }
  }
}

Implications:
- `import { ChatWidget } from "ui";` resolves to /workspace/packages/ui/index.js, which in turn exports ChatWidget from ./ChatWidget.jsx (legacy widget).

Key imports in apps/client:

- /workspace/apps/client/pages/restaurant/[slug].js
  - `import { ChatWidget } from "@tandem/ui-kit";`
  - This page uses the new UI Kit package directly; alias "ui" is not involved here.

- Other pages (based on repository scan):
  - /workspace/apps/client/pages/index.js
  - /workspace/apps/client/pages/chat.js
  - /workspace/apps/client/pages/demo/windmill-creek.js
  - These import `ChatWidget` from "ui", which resolves to packages/ui (legacy), not @tandem/ui-kit.

Conclusion:
- For the Windmill Creek restaurant page specifically, the import is already from "@tandem/ui-kit", so it should be using the new Figma-based ChatWidget implementation.
- The alias mapping for "ui" only affects pages still importing from "ui"; those pages will continue to show the old widget from packages/ui.
- Therefore, if the restaurant page is still showing the old UI, the root cause is not the import path in [slug].js but how @tandem/ui-kit itself resolves and what component it exports as ChatWidget.
